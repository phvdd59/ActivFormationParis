	 * Stacks and queues : StoneWall
	 * 
	 * You are going to build a stone wall. The wall should be straight and N
	 * meters long, and its thickness should be constant; however, it should
	 * have different heights in different places. The height of the wall is
	 * specified by a zero-indexed array H of N positive integers. H[I] is the
	 * height of the wall from I to I+1 meters to the right of its left end. In
	 * particular, H[0] is the height of the wall's left end and H[Nâˆ’1] is the
	 * height of the wall's right end.
	 * 
	 * The wall should be built of cuboid stone blocks (that is, all sides of
	 * such blocks are rectangular). Your task is to compute the minimum number
	 * of blocks needed to build the wall.
	 * 
	 * Write a function:
	 *
	 * class Solution { public int solution(int[] H); }
	 *
	 * that, given a zero-indexed array H of N positive integers specifying the
	 * height of the wall, returns the minimum number of blocks needed to build
	 * it.
	 *
	 * For example, given array H containing N = 9 integers: H[0] = 8 H[1] = 8
	 * H[2] = 5 H[3] = 7 H[4] = 9 H[5] = 8 H[6] = 7 H[7] = 4 H[8] = 8
	 *
	 * the function should return 7. The figure shows one possible arrangement
	 * of seven blocks.

	 * | |____|______________|_____|
	 *
	 *
	 * Assume that:
	 *
	 * N is an integer within the range [1..100,000]; each element of array H is
	 * an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
	 * 
	 * Complexity:
	 *
	 * expected worst-case time complexity is O(N); expected worst-case space
	 * complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage
	 * required for input arguments).
	 *
	 * Elements of input arrays can be modified.
